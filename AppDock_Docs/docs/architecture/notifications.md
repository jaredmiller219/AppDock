# Notifications

- `NSWorkspace.didLaunchApplicationNotification` inserts new apps at the front.
- `NSApplication.didResignActiveNotification` dismisses context menus.
- A local notification is used to dismiss context menus when tapping outside.
- The popover listens for a custom dismiss event posted by the popover container.
