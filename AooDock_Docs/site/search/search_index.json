The app runs as a status item with a popover UI, and it exposes quick actions (hide, quit) via a command-click context menu. Recent Changes Dock updates in real time when new apps launch (launch events insert at the front). Quitting apps stays listed when \u201cKeep apps after quit\u201d is enabled. Context menu dismisses when clicking outside and re-animates when switching apps. Status bar icon now uses a system symbol with a fallback image. Relaunch uses NSWorkspace.OpenConfiguration and openApplication(at:) APIs. Minimized apps are restored via unhide() + activateAllWindows and a relaunch event. Added a Filter & Sort menu button for running-only and name-based ordering. Moved shared filter/sort enums into AppDock/AppDockTypes.swift . Added a SettingsView narration outline in the Video folder. Expanded Settings with persistent layout, behavior, and accessibility preferences. Settings changes now apply on demand and update the live dock layout. Feature Highlights Fixed-size grid with padding slots for a consistent layout. Command-click context menu with Hide/Quit actions. Command-hover remove affordance for manual list cleanup. Lightweight menu bar UI with a centered popover. App list is derived from NSWorkspace running apps and sorted by launch time. Built-in filter and sort menu for list customization. Settings panel includes grid sizing, labels, and behavior toggles stored in UserDefaults . Settings apply directly to the grid size, label size, and running indicators. Glossary Dock Grid : The 3x4 grid of app icons rendered in the popover. Popover : The floating menu bar window that hosts the dock UI. Context Menu : The overlay with Hide/Quit actions for a single app. App Entry : Tuple containing (name, bundleid, icon) stored in AppState . Instructions Build and Run Open AppDock.xcodeproj in Xcode. Select the AppDock scheme. Run the app (menu bar icon appears). Click the status item to open the dock popover. Using the Dock Click an app icon to activate the app. Command-click an icon to open the context menu (Hide/Quit). Command-hover an icon to reveal the remove \u201cX\u201d button. Apps stay listed after they quit when \u201cKeep apps after quit\u201d is enabled. Clicking a listed app that is no longer running relaunches it. Clicking a minimized app should restore its windows (OS behavior may vary). Use the Filter & Sort menu button to switch between running-only and all apps, or reorder by name. Use Settings to configure the default filter/sort, grid size, and behavior toggles. Click Apply in Settings to push changes into the live dock view. Settings Open Settings with \u2318, or use the menu bar app menu and choose Settings\u2026 . Settings persist in UserDefaults via keys defined in SettingsDefaults . Settings edits are staged and only applied when you click Apply. Layout options include grid columns/rows, icon size, and label size. Behavior options include label visibility, hover remove, and quit confirmations. The bottom-left ellipsis menu provides Restore Defaults and Set as Default. Tests In Xcode, select AppDockTests or AppDockUITests targets. Run the tests from the Test navigator. UI launch tests include a screenshot baseline in AppDockUITestsLaunchTests . For unit tests, keep logic isolated and use lightweight mocks (see AppDockTests/RecentAppsController.swift ). Creating a New Unit Test File In Xcode, File > New > File... and choose Unit Test Case Class . Set the target to AppDockTests . Name the file (for example, DockViewLogicTests.swift ). Import your module with @testable import AppDock . Prefer logic-only tests that avoid UI where possible; use lightweight stubs or helpers. Example skeleton: import XCTest @testable import AppDock final class DockViewLogicTests: XCTestCase { func testExample() { // Arrange // Act // Assert } } Creating a New UI Test File In Xcode, File > New > File... and choose UI Test Case Class . Set the target to AppDockUITests . Use XCUIApplication to launch and validate UI behavior. Example skeleton: import XCTest final class AppDockNewUITests: XCTestCase { @MainActor func testMenuOpens() throws { let app = XCUIApplication() app.launch() // Add UI interactions/assertions here } } Adding a New Dock File (Feature Extension) If you want another view or module that extends the dock, follow this pattern: Create a Swift file in AppDock/ (for example, DockOverlayView.swift ). Keep UI views in SwiftUI ( struct MyView: View ) and avoid global state. If you need shared state, add it to AppState or pass it through view initializers. Wire the new view from DockView or MenuController depending on where it appears. Example structure: import SwiftUI struct DockOverlayView: View { let title: String var body: some View { Text(title) .font(.headline) } } To display it in the dock, add it to DockView : DockOverlayView(title: \"Now Playing\") Manually Testing the App (Real Usage) Run the app from Xcode. Verify the status bar icon appears. Click the icon to open the popover. Open a new app (Finder, Notes, etc.) and confirm it appears at the front. Quit an app and confirm it stays listed (if \u201cKeep apps after quit\u201d is enabled). Command-click an icon to open the context menu and test Hide/Quit. Command-hover to verify the remove button appears and removes the item. Open Settings from the menu and confirm the window opens. Debugging Tips Use NSLog or unified logging if output is not visible in Xcode's console. If the popover isn\u2019t visible, check popover.contentSize and the status item configuration in AppDock/RecentAppsController.swift . If icons are missing, verify the bundle URL and icon retrieval in makeAppEntry(from:workspace:) . If minimized windows do not restore, this may require Accessibility APIs. Menu bar apps can log to Console.app; filter by \u201cAppDock\u201d. If filtering appears incorrect, verify the current selection in the Filter & Sort menu and re-open the popover. If settings look off, use Restore Defaults in the Settings ellipsis menu. If a quit app still appears, check the \u201cKeep apps after quit\u201d setting. Common Development Tasks Change grid size : Update defaults in SettingsDefaults or apply new values in Settings. Adjust popover size : Update popover.contentSize in AppDock/RecentAppsController.swift . Add menu actions : Update PopoverContentView in AppDock/MenuController.swift and wire new actions in AppDelegate . Modify app filtering : Edit getRecentApplications() in AppDock/RecentAppsController.swift . Keep apps after quit : Toggle the setting or adjust handleTerminatedApp in AppDock/RecentAppsController.swift . Update settings defaults : Edit SettingsDefaults in AppDock/SettingsView.swift . Apply settings programmatically : Call appState.applySettings(_:) in AppDock/RecentAppsController.swift . Entitlements and Permissions Entitlements live in AppDock/AppDock.entitlements and are mirrored by build settings in AppDock.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj . Network client access is enabled; sandbox is configured for user-selected read-only files. High-Level Behavior On launch, the app reads the current list of running user apps and displays them in a fixed-size grid. When a new app launches, it is inserted at the front of the list. When an app quits, it remains in the list (the dock is not pruned on termination). Command-clicking an icon opens a context menu for Hide/Quit; command-hover reveals the remove control. Detailed Interaction Behavior Status Bar Icon The status bar icon is created at launch and uses a system symbol. The image is marked as template for automatic light/dark rendering. The size is normalized to fit the menu bar. Context Menu Lifecycle Command-click toggles a per-item context menu state. The menu animates in with a scale+fade transition. Clicking outside the dock area posts a dismiss notification and closes the menu. When switching to another app, the menu is re-instantiated to replay the animation. Dock Update Rules On launch, the list is populated from NSWorkspace.shared.runningApplications . Apps are filtered to .regular with a bundle identifier and launch date. New launches insert at index 0 and dedupe existing bundle identifiers. App quits do not remove entries when \u201cKeep apps after quit\u201d is enabled. The Filter & Sort menu can further constrain or reorder the visible list. Settings can change the default filter/sort choice used at startup. App Activation and Relaunch Running apps are unhidden and activated with activateAllWindows . If an app is not running, it is relaunched using openApplication(at:) . Relaunch uses NSWorkspace.OpenConfiguration with activates = true . Relaunch logic is centralized in ButtonView via the openApp(bundleId:) helper. Minimized vs Hidden unhide() targets hidden apps; minimized windows should restore on activation. Some apps may not restore minimized windows without Accessibility APIs. If a specific app does not restore, consider enabling an AX-based restore flow. Architecture Overview SwiftUI App + AppDelegate : RecentAppsController is the SwiftUI entry point while AppDelegate owns the status bar item and popover. Shared State : AppState is an ObservableObject that publishes the recentApps list for the UI. Shared Types : AppDockTypes.swift holds the filter/sort enums used by the UI. Popover UI : MenuController builds the popover host, with DockView rendering the grid and menu rows. Workspace Monitoring : NSWorkspace notifications are used to insert new apps as they launch. Data Model AppState.recentApps : Array of tuples (name: String, bundleid: String, icon: NSImage) . Icons are sized to 64x64 before being stored in state to keep rendering consistent. AppState.filterOption : Selected AppFilterOption for filtering. AppState.sortOption : Selected AppSortOption for sorting. SettingsDefaults : Centralized UserDefaults keys and default values for Settings. SettingsDraft : Staged settings values applied to AppState on demand. Runtime Flow RecentAppsController starts and wires the AppDelegate . AppDelegate creates the status bar item and the popover content via MenuController . getRecentApplications() loads running apps and updates AppState on the main thread. NSWorkspace.didLaunchApplicationNotification inserts new apps at the front of the list. DockView renders the grid and handles interactions (activation, context menu, remove). Notifications and Observers NSWorkspace.didLaunchApplicationNotification inserts new apps at the front. NSApplication.didResignActiveNotification dismisses context menus. A local notification is used to dismiss context menus when tapping outside. The popover listens for a custom dismiss event posted by the popover container. Testing Strategy AppDockTests covers logic-level behaviors with local stubs and mocks. AppDockUITests provides the Xcode template UI test scaffolding and a launch screenshot baseline. Testing Matrix Unit Tests (Logic) Sorting, filtering, and icon sizing in getRecentApplications() . Launch insertion and de-duplication in handleLaunchedApp(_:) . Dock padding math and removal index adjustment. Command-click context menu state toggling. Settings default values and UserDefaults restore behavior. Settings apply behavior and quit-removal handling. UI Tests (Launch) App launches and is running (foreground or background). Launch screenshot captured after startup. Settings UI test opens the window via \u2318, and verifies Apply + ellipsis actions. Integration Test Ideas Launch app, open popover, verify dock grid exists. Trigger command-click with simulated input (if possible) to open context menu. Open and close the popover repeatedly to check animations and dismissal. Open a test app, ensure it appears at the top of the dock list. Edge Case Checklist Running app missing bundle identifier or launch date is filtered out. Running app missing localized name or bundle URL is ignored. App is the same bundle as AppDock itself (ignored in launch handler). Duplicate bundle identifier launches are de-duplicated. Empty list is padded to a fixed 3x4 grid. Removing an item adjusts the active context menu index correctly. Troubleshooting Menu Bar Icon Not Showing Ensure makeStatusBarImage() returns a valid image. Verify statusBarItem.button?.image is set in applicationDidFinishLaunching . Popover Does Not Appear Verify statusBarItem.button is non-nil. Check popover.contentSize and popover.show(...) positioning. App Does Not Reactivate Confirm the bundle identifier is valid and app URL is found. Some apps may ignore activation when sandboxed or in special states. Minimized Windows Not Restoring Some apps require Accessibility APIs to explicitly unminimize. Consider adding an AX-based restore path if this is a requirement. Future Enhancements Optional removal of quit apps after a timeout or on next launch. Accessibility-based window unminimize for consistent restoration. User-configurable grid sizing and sorting.
